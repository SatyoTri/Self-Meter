Our project addresses the widespread issue of untreated mental health conditions which impact well-being, productivity, and social relationships, due to stigma, limited resources, and lack of awareness, by leveraging digital technology for accessible and scalable support.

## Main Features

Users can complete a mental health questionnaire. Based on the results, the application generates graphs depicting various mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders. These graphs help users track their conditions over time and identify patterns. Personalized suggestions are then provided to help manage and improve mental wellbeing.
